       " 'This proposed implementation is intended to provide decision makers with an ability to interactively assess the value (from a functional and capability standpoint) of aggregations of EW systems and suites for various airframes.',\n",
       " 'The notional example presented is based on a rapid prototype developed by GTRI to illustrate how such a process could be implemented quickly as an Excel tradeoff tool to evaluate various EW suites for a USAF combat aircraft.',\n",
       " 'The process and tool could be extended to allow for the comparison of multiple types of aircraft flying independent and joint missions.',\n",
       " 'The process is intended to integrate the world-view and concerns from two groups of stakeholders, namely (1) the domain subject matter experts (SMEs), and (2) the decision makers (DMs).',\n",
       " 'The SMEs are experts in at least some portion of the operational and technological aspects of a particular concern (e.g., for electronic warfare, they may be well versed in how the USAF employs EW assets and equipment, or how the technology and/or adversary is evolving).',\n",
       " 'The DMs have to integrate the inputs from groups of SMEs to identify solutions that balance the concerns within a wide range of conditions or needs, including mission, scenarios, budget, etc.',\n",
       " 'The dialogue between the two groups is key to identifying suitable solutions in a timely manner.',\n",
       " 'There are multiple risks involved with insufficient communication between the two groups, e.g., (1) having the SMEs ignore or not be aware of concerns that are critical to the DMs, (2) DMs being unaware of tacit assumptions by the SMEs which invalidate a higher level decision.',\n",
       " 'These risks often manifest themselves during a decision exercise (where SMEs are generally not available) or during a SMEs’ briefing to the DMs.',\n",
       " 'These misunderstandings may require the SMEs to reconvene to reassess their recommendations to the DMs, bogging the process down.',\n",

       " 'This approach is agile in the sense that as new information (e.g., new intel, new specifications from decision makers) is provided, the team can pivot and take it into account in an ad-hoc manner.',\n",
