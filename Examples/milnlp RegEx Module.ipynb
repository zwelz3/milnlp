       "[{'Mission Description and Budget Item Justification': \" Air Force Integrated Personnel and Pay System (AFIPPS) will be a web-enabled, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution that will integrate existing personnel and pay processes into one self-service system. The Department of the Air Force (DAF) plans to accomplish this goal by modernizing existing technology, resulting in a secure and authoritative data environment that improves accuracy, strengthens decision making and reduces processing time and costs. AFIPPS supports effective military personnel management and development throughout the lifecycle of all military members, by providing an accurate and single authoritative source of personnel data. Active (RegAF), National Guard (ANG),and Reserve (AFRes) components will integrate personnel and pay functionality; streamline and improve automated support to the mobilization and deployment processes; and implement standard data that reflects the core requirements of the Combatant Commands, the Department of the Air Force, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other federal agencies. Congress, the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions on how the US military is organized, operated, maintained, and funded. The AFIPPS program will ensure accurate and timely delivery of pay, entitlements, allowances, and benefits information is provided for the Total Force (Active Duty, Guard, and Reserve). AFIPPS represents the AF commitment to modernize business practices and provide enhanced support to service members and their families by integrating personnel and pay systems. AFIPPS will eliminate AF reliance on the end-of-life/unsustainable Defense Finance and Accounting (DFAS) Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) for payroll processing and will ensure continued/improved auditability of service member pay. The AFIPPS approach follows the DoD principle of pursuing enterprise solutions, not enterprise systems. Efforts are underway to establish DoD-level enterprise governance, ensure common standards, and create shared services while pursuing a distinctive approach appropriate for the AF. AFIPPS's customers include approximately 510,000 AF service members across all components (RegAF, ANG, and AFRes) including thousands of military leaders of different ranks, specialties, and career fields who are responsible for the conduct of AF operations that rely on these services to ensure service members with the appropriate skill sets are deployed where needed at home and on the battlefield. Congress, the rest of the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies all rely on accurate AF Human Resources (HR) data to make key decisions that affect how the US military is organized, funded, deployed, and maintained. This program element may include necessary civilian pay expenses required to manage, execute, and deliver integrated personnel and pay capability. The use of such program funds would be in addition to the civilian pay expenses budgeted in program elements 0605826F, 0605827F, 0605828F, 0605829F, 0605830F, 0605831F, PE 0605018F: AF Integrated Personnel and Pay System \",\n",

       "  'Other Program Funding Summary': \" ($ in Millions) AFIPPS acquisition strategy focuses on expanding the fielded AF personnel system (MilPDS) by integrating a pay capability. MilPDS is implemented using the commercial Oracle ERP E-Business Suite (EBS). The AFIPPS strategy will be to configure/develop the pay portion of EBS, ensure the system is fully integrated, and deployed. The Government will award a contract for the pay system development, test, and deployment. The development activities will be fully coordinated and integrated with the on-going operation and sustainment of MilPDS. Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Business and Enterprise Systems (AFPEO BES) is the PEO for AFIPPS. Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) is the Contracting Authority for the AFIPPS Program and provides Contracts, Legal, and Comptroller support.
